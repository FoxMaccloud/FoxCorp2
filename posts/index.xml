            <description>I started doing pwnable a few months back. I think the site is very cool and very good for learning basic binary exploiting skills. I wanted to add some more contents to this site so I made a writeup for the first challenge.
My first writeup can be found Here
There will be more writeups comming in the future, but I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on making a writeup for the Fatty machine from Hack The Box first.</description>

            <description>Hi, and welcome to my new domain!
I made this website using the Hugo framework instead of writing up own html &amp;amp; css. I will use this website to post all my content, ideas and future projects. I will also add writeups for challenges at a later date, so stay tuned!
Check out whoami for more information about who I am.</description>
