      <description>This challenge is quite simple, it has no protection against the hacker. Just use buffer overflow to change the return address and you can leak stack address. You can then send your shellcode to get the flag.
Finding the buffer size I used a tool Overflow Exploit Pattern Generator generating a 50 character long string. Running the executable trough tools such as GDB Enhanced Features (GEF) and checking the contents of the EIP registry, we can see the string &amp;ldquo;6Aa7&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Hi, and welcome to my new domain!
I made this website using the Hugo framework instead of writing up own html &amp;amp; css. I will use this website to post all my content, ideas and future projects. I will also add writeups for challenges at a later date, so stay tuned!
Check out whoami for more information about who I am.</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Fox Maccloud! I started getting into infosec 4 years ago. It all started messing with video games and computers as a kid and wondered how shit works&amp;hellip;
I sadly was not able to really get into hacking at this age since searching &amp;ldquo;How to become a hacker&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly yield any decent results.
Skipping a few years, last year of highschool I started to learn how to do programming mainly python and set up services such as game servers and other services.</description>
