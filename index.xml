      <description>Hi, and welcome to my new domain!
I made this website using the Hugo framework instead of writing up own html &amp;amp; css. I will use this website to post all my content, ideas and future projects. I will also add writeups for challenges at a later date, so stay tuned!
Check out whoami for more information about who I am.</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Fox Maccloud! I started getting into infosec 4 years ago. It all started messing with video games and computers as a kid and wondered how shit works&amp;hellip;
I sadly was not able to really get into hacking at this age since searching &amp;ldquo;How to become a hacker&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly yield any decent results.
Skipping a few years, last year of highschool I started to learn how to do programming mainly python and set up services such as game servers and other services.</description>
