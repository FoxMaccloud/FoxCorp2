<p>I started getting into infosec when I was about 17 years old. It all started messing much earlier with video games and computers as a kid
and wondered how shit works&hellip;</p>
<p>I sadly was not able to really get into hacking at this age since searching &ldquo;How to become a hacker&rdquo;
doesn&rsquo;t exactly yield any decent results.</p>
<p>Skipping a few years, last year of highschool I started to learn how to do programming mainly python and set up services such as game servers and other services. I later then got into hacking.</p>
<p>As for now I&rsquo;m just trying to develop my skills, do capture the flag challenges and finish university.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-blog">About the blog</h2>
<p>My goal for this blog is to have a hub for all my contents.
I&rsquo;m gonna write writeups for challanges I do, post research and share ideas.</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
<p>If you want to contact me, <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxMacSwagger">Twitter</a> is a good way to get in contact!

<p>I used to be most active on <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/38606">Hack The Box</a>, <a href="https://pwnable.tw/">Pwnable.tw</a> and <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">Try Hack Me</a>, but I&rsquo;m kinda burned out of them at the moment. Now days I&rsquo;m enjoying reverse engineering, game hacking, taking things apart and put them back together in a different way. Much like I used to as a kid :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also the co-leader of Pwngasms which we created in the summer 2019.</p>
